- **Skill Overwriting**: If a later joiner has a **higher-level skill** than an earlier member, the higher-level skill will replace the lower one in the rally’s buffs.
- **Avoiding Weak Buffs**: Do **not** use heroes whose **first expedition skill** does not enhance damage, as this can reduce the rally’s overall effectiveness.
